Answer Breakdown:
Line 1: Lets the user select the column that is labeled product_name which is column 2 for this table
Line 2: Specifies which table the data is retrieved from
Line 3: Lets the user specify what value from column product_type the user wants. While also requiring the price 
of the product type to be less than 2000. product_type has to equal "laptops" and the price is under 2000 for 
this to return true
